This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes ('/*') in React Router v6. The problem arises when other routes are defined before the catch-all route.  This example shows how to correctly implement catch-all routes to handle unmatched paths.  The solution provides a corrected version of the routes configuration to ensure the catch-all route functions as intended.
